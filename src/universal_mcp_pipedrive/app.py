It may be used to store the user's session ID from your app or distinguish different responses. Using state may increase security; see RFC-6749.

        Args:
            id (string): id
            title (string): The title of the goal
            assignee (object): Who this goal is assigned to. It requires the following JSON structure: `{ "id": "1", "type": "person" }`. `type` can be either `person`, `company` or `team`. ID of the assignee person, company or team.
            type (object): The type of the goal. It requires the following JSON structure: `{ "name": "deals_started", "params": { "pipeline_id": [1, 2], "activity_type_id": [9] } }`. Type can be one of: `deals_won`, `deals_progressed`, `activities_completed`, `activities_added`, `deals_started` or `revenue_forecast`. `params` can include `pipeline_id`, `stage_id` or `activity_type_id`. `stage_id` is related to only `deals_progressed` type of goals and `activity_type_id` to `activities_completed` or `activities_added` types of goals. The `pipeline_id` and `activity_type_id` need to be given as an array of integers. To track the goal in all pipelines, set `pipeline_id` as `null` and similarly, to track the goal for all activities, set `activity_type_id` as `null`.”
            expected_outcome (object): The expected outcome of the goal. Expected outcome can be tracked either by `quantity` or by `sum`. It requires the following JSON structure: `{ "target": "50", "tracking_metric": "quantity" }` or `{ "target": "50", "tracking_metric": "sum", "currency_id": 1 }`. `currency_id` should only be added to `sum` type of goals.
            duration (object): The date when the goal starts and ends. It requires the following JSON structure: `{ "start": "2019-01-01", "end": "2022-12-31" }`. Date in format of YYYY-MM-DD. "end" can be set to `null` for an infinite, open-ended goal.
